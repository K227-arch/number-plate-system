# Number Plate Detection System

## Overview
This Number Plate Detection System uses image processing and machine learning techniques to detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images or video streams. The system can be used for applications such as parking management, toll collection, and traffic monitoring.

## Features
- Detects vehicle number plates from images or live video feeds.
- Extracts and recognizes the characters on the number plates.
- Supports multiple formats and image resolutions.
- Can be integrated with existing surveillance systems.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV (Image processing)
  - Tesseract (Optical Character Recognition - OCR)
  - NumPy (Scientific computing)
  - Matplotlib (Plotting and visualization)
  - Pillow (Image manipulation)
- **Machine Learning**:
  - trained models from scratch
